# 🤖 AI API Aggregator 🗨️

## 👋 **Intro:**
- This project is a web application that allows users to chat with various AI models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. You can seamlessly switch between different models mid-conversation, making it easy to compare outputs or find the best model for your needs.
- The application comes with a variety of built-in prompts optimized for specific tasks, enhancing the AI's performance across different use cases.

## 📦 **Tech Stack:**
- React
- TypeScript
- OpenAI (ChatGPT) API
- Anthropic (Claude) API
- Google (Gemini) API
- HTML/Tailwind CSS

## 👩🏽‍🍳 **Features:**
- Chat with multiple AI models (OpenAI's GPT models, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini models).
- Switch between AI models mid-conversation.
- Built-in task-specific prompts for optimized performance.
- Real-time conversation updates.
- User-friendly interface for model selection and chat interaction.

## 💭 **Process:**
1. Set up the React environment with TypeScript for type safety.
2. Integrated multiple AI APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) into the application.
3. Designed and implemented the chat interface with real-time updates.
4. Created a model selector component for easy switching between AI providers and models.
5. Developed a system for managing and applying task-specific prompts.
6. Implemented error handling and loading states for a smooth user experience.
7. Optimized the application for both desktop and mobile use.

## 📚 **What I Learned:**
- Gained experience in working with multiple AI APIs and their unique characteristics.
- Deepened understanding of React and TypeScript for building complex, interactive applications.
- Learned strategies for optimizing AI model performance through carefully crafted prompts.
- Improved skills in creating responsive and user-friendly interfaces for chat applications.

## ✨ **Potential Improvements:**
- Implement user authentication to save conversation history.
- Add a feature to compare responses from multiple models side-by-side.
- Integrate a system for users to save and share their favorite prompts.
- Implement streaming responses for faster interaction with AI models that support it.
- Add support for more AI providers and models as they become available.

## 🚦 **Running the Project:**
To run the project locally:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Set up environment variables for API keys:
  ```
  REACT_APP_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
  REACT_APP_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
  REACT_APP_GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_api_key
```
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## 🔒 **Note on API Keys:**
This project requires API keys from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and subscriptions from these providers. Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to version control.
